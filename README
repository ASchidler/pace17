This project is a solver for the Steiner Tree Problem on Graphs

Unfortunately the code is at the moment not cleaned up and therefore contains a lot of unused source code.

Folder structure:
- instances; contains the PACE 2018 public instances
- steiner; contains the actual source code

To run the solver use:
python steiner/steiner_tu.py < <Input File>

For example:
python steiner/steiner_tu.py < instances/lowTerm/instance001.gr

The input and output format is described here https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2018/

Source code folder structure:
- <Main Folder>: Runscripts, testscripts and single classes that fit nowhere else.
- iparser: Contains parsers for input
- oparser: Contains parsers convert the result
- preselection: Contains reductions that preselect edges
- reduction: Contains reductions that remove part of the graph
- solver: Contains the actual solvers. Please note that only solver2k.py is used. The other solvers were never completed.
- solver.heuristics: Lower bounds that can be used during the solving process
